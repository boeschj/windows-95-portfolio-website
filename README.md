# Hi, my name is Jordan Boesch

## About Me

I am a software dev who likes to create awesome things that benefit people, and I enjoy building new and innovative products from the ground up.

## About This Repo

This is a Windows 95 themed personal website that I created using Next.js, Tailwind, and deployed using Vercel. The site provides an overview of my experience and skills.

For my resume and a more in-depth summary of my work, check out the deployed site [here](https://www.jordanboesch.com)!
