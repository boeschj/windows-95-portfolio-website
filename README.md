# Hi, my name is Jordan Boesch


## About Me
I am a software dev who likes to create awesome things that benefit people, and I enjoy building new and innovative products from the ground up. I am also fascinated by the intersection of creativity and engineering, which has led me to focus on building in the crypto/web3 space.

## Skill summary
I've worked as a full-stack developer on 4 early stage products/companies and am most familiar with React, Node.js (typescript), Next.js, and Python. I also have experience working with the full web3 stack in various capacities.
