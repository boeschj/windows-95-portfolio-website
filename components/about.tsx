                    I am a software developer who enjoys building new and innovative products from the ground up.
                    I am also fascinated by the intersection of creativity and engineering, which has led me to focus on building in the crypto/web3 space.

                <span>
                    I've worked as a full-stack developer on 3 early stage companies, including my own that I founded in 2021.

                    I'm experienced with JS frameworks such as React, Node.js (typescript), Next.js, and Python.
                    I also have experience working with the full web3 stack on Ethereum.
