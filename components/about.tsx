                    I'm a software developer who enjoys building new and innovative products from the ground up.
                    I am also fascinated by the intersection of creativity and engineering, which has led me to focus on building in the crypto/web3 space.

                    My interest in software development started in 2019 when I taught myself some Visual Basic to program an Excel macro script to automate parts of a data-entry job I was working at the time.
                    Flash forward to the present, and I've now worked as a full-stack developer on 3 early stage companies, including my own that I founded in 2021.

                    Most recently I've been working with React, Node.js (typescript), Next.js, and GraphQL.
